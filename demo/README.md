# THREE.js / WebGL Demo
The website contained in this folder is a demo of some basic 3D rendering on the web. 

To load this demo website you will need a web server. We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with this tutorial because it has a really easy to use [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). 
Once it's installed, all you have to do is right click your `.html` file and choose the option **Open with Live Server**.
Not only will your web page open in the browser, any changes you make to the source file are immediately reflected in the browser.
Other IDEs may also have a similar feature that you can use.

The only dependency for this demo is the source code of `THREE.js` which has already been downloaded and saved into the `js` directory for you.
If you want to download it yourself, you can do so from the [official `threejs.org` website](https://threejs.org/build/three.js).

We've also made a [video walkthrough of the demo](https://youtu.be/K_Z1ZWucn-c) available on YouTube.
